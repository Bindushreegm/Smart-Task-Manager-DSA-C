Smart Task Manager using C (DSA)
About the Project:

This project is a menu-driven Smart Task Manager written in C.
I built this project to understand how Data Structures and Algorithms can be used in a simple real-life application like managing tasks.

The program allows the user to add tasks, view them, and search for a task based on the given input.

Why I Chose This Project=

While learning DSA in C, I wanted a project that is:

Easy to understand

Practical

Helpful in learning structures, arrays, and searching

A task manager felt like a good example to apply these concepts instead of writing only theory-based programs.

What the Program Can Do:

Add a new task with a priority

Display all the tasks

Search for a task using its ID

Show tasks in a simple menu format

Concepts Used:

Structure (struct) to store task details

Array of structures to store multiple tasks

Linear search to find a task

Bubble sort to arrange tasks by priority

Loops and switch-case for menu handling

How It Works:

The program displays a menu

User selects an option

Based on the choice, the program performs the operation

The menu is shown again until the user exits

How to Run=

Compile the program using GCC:

gcc smart_task_manager.c -o task_manager


Run the program:

./task_manager

Output:

I have uploaded screenshots in this repository which show:

The main menu

Adding tasks

Viewing tasks

Searching for a task

Limitations:

The number of tasks is limited because arrays are used

Tasks are not saved once the program is closed

This is a command-line program with no GUI

What I Learned

How to use structures in C:

How searching and sorting work in a real program

How to design a menu-driven application

How DSA concepts are applied practically

Future Improvements:
*Add delete and update options
*Use file handling to save tasks
*Use linked lists instead of arrays
